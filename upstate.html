<h1> Stan zooms upstate NY knowing that longer trips would equal more money. He's hoping to make enough to pay the rent for the month and for him and his wife to go out on a date by the end of the week. Later in the day he reaches his 8th pick up. Buisness is good. The riders name is Stacey she is very chatty from the start of the ride and Stan becomes irritated. </h1>
